# Self Driving Car

A HTML/JS app showing a rudimentary neural network learning how to drive a car. The neural net is built completely in JavaScript and is visualized while the app is running.  

The neural network runs 500 cars in parallel for quicker learning, tuning the network to the weights and biases of the cars that are avoiding traffic the best.

## Running the code

The code is written in plain HTML/CSS/JS without any libraries. Therefore to run it, simply pull the code from this repository, locate yourself in the directory containing the code  
and run `start index.html`.
